        Flag channels were initialized with zeros. Non-zero values have the following significance:
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        1 = Sample for this measurement was collected but not analyzed. Sample lost.
        2 = Acceptable Measurement
        3 = Questionable Measurement (Probably Good)
        4 = Poor Measurement (Probably Bad)
        5 = Measurement Not Reported (Bad)
        6 = Mean of replicate measurements
        7 = Manual chromatographic peak measurement

*COMMENTS
    Salinity samples were gathered during CTD casts using a Niskin bottle attached above
        the CTD. The depths are nominal and were estimated based on wire out on the ship.

    Extracted chlorophyll samples were gathered at about 0m and 5m on separate casts
        run shortly after the CTD casts.

    Analysis methods:
    -----------------
        Chlorophyll samples were filtered onto 25mm GF/F filters and stored in glass
        scintillation vials at -20C prior to analysis. Samples were extracted in
        90% acetone at -20C for 24 hours in the lab and analyzed on a Turner 10AU fluorometer
        calibrated with commercially pure chlorophyll a standard (Sigma).
        Fluorescence readings taken before and after acidification were used to
        calculate chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations (Holm-Hansen et al 1965).
        Chlorophyll samples were analyzed at IOS in Room 2423 up to 8 weeks after each leg.
        The average of two samples is reported. Variability is assessed as the
        CV% (std dev / mean*100).
        Flags and comments apply to chlorophyll values only.
        Precision Statement: Chlorophyll values ranged from 0.34-33.09 ug/l. Average %CV for
          this cruise was 7.87% with 7 out of 54 duplicate pairs having a CV>15% and 1 out
          of 54 duplicate pairs having a CV>50%. Our average dataset %CV is 4% for 2013-2014.
          So the overall quality of this data set is below average.
        For details including the precision study see file QF2015-22CHL*.xlsx.

        Salinity samples were collected in 200 mL type ll glass bottles with
        disposable nylon inserts and screw caps supplied by Ocean Scientific
        International Limited. They were analyzed in a temperature-controlled lab at IOS
        on a Guildline 8400B Salinometer (S/N 68572) standardized with IAPSO standard
        seawater approximately 20 to 146 days after collection with the greatest delays
        for the samples collected in March. The samples collected in July and August
        were analyzed within 23 days. All other samples waited for more than 2months.
        For details including a precision study, see document QF2015-22SAL*.xls.
