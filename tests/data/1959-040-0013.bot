         This file was created by MEDS
         MEDS File name : 180259740_0013
         Data quality is expressed with the following flags
            0 = not checked
            1 = appears to be good
            2 = inconsistent with climatology
            3 = appears to be doubtful
            4 = appears to be wrong
            5 = value was changed, see the history record
         Q_DATE_TIME is the quality of the date/time
         Q_RECORD is the worst quality flag for the entire station expressed
             as 1,2,3,5,4,0 from best to worst
         QC_VERSION is the version of quality control software used

        DUP_FLAG indicates if another profile exists in MEDS that is of
             higher quality (0=N= no duplicate)
        DIGIT_CODE indicates the type of digitization used
        STANDARD indicates the precision of the observation

      IDENT is a code idicating the agency writing this history record
      PRC_CODE is the identifier of the software writing this history record
      VERSION is the version of the software used
      PRC_DATE is the date as YYYYMMDD this record was written
      ACT_CODE tells what action was taken against the data
      ACT_PARM = idicates whhich parameter was acted on
      AUX-ID helps to further quality the parameter affected
      O_VALUE was the original value of the parameter if an action changed it

      The data in this file were collected from MEDS and reformatted or
        transcribed from the publication:
           Oceanographic Data Record
           Coastal Seaways Project
           November 16 to December 11, 1959
           Pacific Oceanographic Group, 1959
           Canadian Committee on Oceanography

      Quality flags had been added to the MEDS files but the entries were
        inappropriate in many cases, so the flag channels were removed.
      Quality checks were made and a few corrections were applied.

    **********************************************************************************************
    NOTE: The speed check showed unreasonably high speed between casts #13 and 14; this is because
      two vessels were used for this cruise, and those casts were on different vessels.
