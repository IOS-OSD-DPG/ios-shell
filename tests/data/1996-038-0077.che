    Nov 11, 1998 - corrected latiitude from 48 to 49 degrees. J.L.

    Analysis methods:
    -----------------

      Salinity samples are collected in glass bottles and analyzed on Guildline
      model 8410 Portasal Salinometers which are standardized with IAPSO standard
      seawater.

      Oxygen samples are analyzed on an automated Winkler titration system
      following the procedures of Carpenter (1965). A Brinkmann model 665 Dosimat
      and model PC910 Colorimeter is controlled by Visual-Basic program to
      titrate the oxygen samples.

      Nutrient samples were measured using an Autoanalyzer II, following the
      procedures outlined in Barwell-Clarke and Whitney (1997). Nitrate/silicate
      samples were defrosted about 24 h before analysis. Phosphate samples were
      rapidly defrosted in moving room temperature air or warm water. Lab
      temperature was noted periodically, and may be found on the original data
      sheets; it was generally around 26C.
