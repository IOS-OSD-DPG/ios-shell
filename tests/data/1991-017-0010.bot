            (not normally used).
        2 = Acceptable measurement (Flag 'b' also reported as ' ')
        3 = Questionable measurement (no problem observed in sampling or analysis,
            but value is not trusted, nonetheless; includes outlyers).
        4 = Bad measurement (known problem with sampling or analysis, but not
            serious enough to completely discard the value).
        5 = Not reported (lost sample; unredeemably bad measurement).
        6 = Mean of replicate measurements.
        7 = Manual chromatographic peak measurement.

    C          which consists of direct colorimetric titration by HCl acid in an
    C          open system.  A mixed indicator (methylene blue and methylene red)
    C          is used to visually determine the equivalence point (color changes
    C          from geen to light pink).  The titration is carried out under a
    C          continuous flow of CO2 free air (or nitrogen gas).
    C          The equivalence point is reached at approximately pH 5.4 - 5.5 .
    C          The precision of the method is about 0.2% .

    C        - determined by IOS using potentiometric titration in a closed cell.
    C          IOS Alkalinity Vol,Emf data acquired from Metrohm 636 Titroprocessor
    C          using PC program 'GTITR211.BAS'.
    C          IOS Alkalinity was computed using PC program 'TALKY117.BAS'
    C          Some IOS Alkalinity values were recomputed due to an Acid concentrati
    C          recalibration on approx May 10 1991.
    C          The original Acid Normality of 0.2506 (mol/L) was replaced by
    C          0.2524 (mol/L).    The final corrected values are used here.
    C          Duplicate samples are averaged - see flag "f"
