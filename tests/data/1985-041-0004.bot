*COMMENTS
    Many bottle files for this cruise were created in 2003, but some samples
     were missed.

    This file was created in June 2012 by Germaine Gatien based on the Daily Log
     of the Ocean Physics Group and salinity and dissolved oxygen analysis logs.
     Estimates for the sampling depth were made based on the maximum sampling of
     the CTD plus log notes that many samples came from 2 or 3m above the bottom.
     The depths are estimates.

    The samples were taken at the bottom of the CTD cast with the same name.

    Collection methods:
    -------------------
      Salinity:
      - Collected in bottles.
      Dissolved Oxygen:
      - Collected in bottles.

    Analyzes methods:
    -------------------------
      Salinity determinations were made at sea with a Guildline model 8400 lab
      salinometer.

      The dissolved oxygen analyses were done in the shipboard laboratory by a
      modified Winkler method (Carpenter, 1965).
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Some of the bottle samples from this cruise were originally archived
       as coming from cruise 1985-21, but they were actually collected during
       cruise 1985-41. Many of the dissolved oxygen samples were missing
       from the 1985-41 files, so the 2 sets were combined. In the course of the
       revision it was found that other bottle samples were missing from both
       sets, so those data were added which involved creating some new BOT files.
       For details on the revisions see file 1985-41-processing-revisions.doc.
