     RE: Conversion of Ocean Ecology Bottle data base
     ------------------------------------------------
     Ocean Ecology bottle database files from 1979-1990 were
     converted from DBASE/ACCESS files to IOSHEADER files. The
     Source ACCESS database (including queries and code) is
     OE_BOTTV3.MDB.  The original database contained additional
     "channels", including ammonia, and CTD-derived Temp, salinity
     chlorophyll (in vivo fluorescence) and transmissometer.

     Some of these data and the measurements procedures
     are described in detail in a series of technical reports in
     Canadian Data Report of Hydrography and Ocean Sciences (CDRHOS)
     and  Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences
     as outlined below:

    SOME Warnings:

    The data from the transmissometer has some known deficiencies.
    At times, values are reported here that are greater than the
    theoretical maximum transmission for pure water.

    The data from the fluorometer (on the CTD) has been converted to
    Chlorophyll a using linear regression on observed extracted chl a
    values (on a cruise-by-cruise basis.  There is often a large scatter
    about this relationship, due to variations in the in vivo fluorescence
    to extracted chl a ratio. There will also be some small NEGATIVE
    values reported (due to the above problems with scattter).

    The CTD Temperature and Salinity are included here, but the PRIMARY
    source for T and S data is in the corresponding CTD files. A few wild
    values in SALINITY (> 34.5) were set to -99.99 on output to the IOS
    HEADER format files.

    The original database contains AMMONIA Data, but these data are not
    extracted here, as there is SERIOUS concerns about the data quality
    and accuracy.

    The Profile numbers/file names WILL NOT necessarily match the profile
    numbers/file names for the CTD files. All files were numbered sequentially
    and there is not always bottle data for each CTD profile (and vice versa).

    CORRECTION: Depths were entered in reverse order. A text editor was used
      to correct the depths and then reorder on increasing depth.
